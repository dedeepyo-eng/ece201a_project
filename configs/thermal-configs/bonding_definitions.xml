    name : Name of bonding.
    diameter : Diameter of the bonding BGA ball. Used only if shape is sphere. Specified in um.
    shape : Shape of the bonding BGA ball.
    cross_section_area : Cross section area of the bonding BGA ball. Needs to be mentioned and is used only if shape is not sphere. Specified in um^2.
    pitch : Pitch of the bonding BGA balls. Specified in um. Assuming a single pitch in both x and y directions. Centre to centre distance.
    material : Material of the bonding BGA ball.
    offset : Offset of the centre of the bonding BGA ball from the starting corner individually in both direction (x & y). Specified in um. Assuming a single offset in both x and y directions.
    height : Height of the bonding BGA ball. Used only if the ball is a cube or a cuboid. Specified in um.
